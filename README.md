# Amanda-Yu-Projects
1. Final project from Applied Statistics and Data Science
- Finds predictors of life expectancy and statistical analysis of it

2. Gaussian Elimination calculator made for linear Algebra

3. FInal Linear Algebra Project: Using SDV to detect Masked vs Unmasked Facial recognition
- Utilized scikit-learn (sklearn) for data preprocessing, PCA, and classification
- Explored the role of matrix transformations, eigenvalues/eigenvectors, and PCA in high-dimensional image data
- Evaluated model performance using metrics like accuracy, precision, and recall

4. Final project from intro to python course
