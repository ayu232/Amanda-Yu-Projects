1. Final project from intro to python course

2. Final project from Applied Statistics and Data Science

    Finds predictors of life expectancy and statistical analysis of it

3. Gaussian Elimination calculator made for linear Algebra

4. FInal Linear Algebra Project: Using SDV to detect Masked vs Unmasked Facial recognition
- Utilized scikit-learn (sklearn) for data preprocessing, PCA, and classification
- Explored the role of matrix transformations, eigenvalues/eigenvectors, and PCA in high-dimensional image data
- Evaluated model performance using metrics like accuracy, precision, and recall
