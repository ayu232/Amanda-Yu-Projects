# Amanda-Yu-Projects
1. Final project from Applied Statistics and Data Science
- Finds predictors of life expectancy and statistical analysis of it

2. Gaussian Elimination calculator made for Linear Algebra

3. FInal Linear Algebra Project: Using SDV to detect Masked vs Unmasked Facial recognition
- Utilized scikit-learn (sklearn) for data preprocessing, PCA, and classification
- Explored the role of matrix transformations, eigenvalues/eigenvectors, and PCA in high-dimensional image data
- Evaluated model performance using metrics like accuracy, precision, and recall

4. Sentence Transformer: Product Matching
- Fine-tuned Hugging Face all-MiniLM-L6-V2 using Multiple Negatives Ranking Loss (MNRL) for robust retrieval-based product matching
- Implemented late fusion of sentence embeddings and CLIP image embeddings (with PCA dimensionality reduction) to integrate text + visual features
- Improved retrieval metrics (Accuracy@10 ↑ 0.53 → 0.59, NDCG@10 ↑ 0.28 → 0.30) across Sephora and Ulta product catalogs
- Addressed inconsistent retailer naming conventions by leveraging multimodal embeddings for more accurate cross-platform product alignment
